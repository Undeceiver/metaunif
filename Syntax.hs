-- End of flat meta-variables section.

-- Start of second-order meta-variables section.
-- This is a limited second-order variables, which means several things.
--	Semantically, they can only be replaced by elements of the second-order Herbrand universe. That is, they are only elements in the space generated by functions in the signature and composition.
--	Syntactically, they are never quantified over, and there are no second-order functions.
-- In other words, they are only function symbols, variable functions and compositions with those, and with the semantic restriction that their interpretation are only elements in the second-order Herbrand universe.
-- Implementation detail: The simplest way to represent compositions of arities greater than 1 is to use lambda abstractions, but we do this by composing with projections whenever necessary The main attractive of this is that we can compare and combine second-order terms without any need for context or without considering alpha-equivalence.
