-- End of flat meta-variables section.

-- Start of second-order meta-variables section.
-- This is a limited second-order variables, which means several things.
--	Semantically, they can only be replaced by elements of the second-order Herbrand universe. That is, they are only elements in the space generated by functions in the signature and composition.
--	Syntactically, they are never quantified over, and the only second-order functions are constants.
-- In other words, they are only variable functions and compositions with those, and with the semantic restriction that their interpretation are only elements in the second-order Herbrand universe.
-- Implementation detail: The simplest way to represent compositions of arities greater than 1 is to use lambda abstractions, but we do so using an extension of De Bruijn indices to multiple parameters. The main attractive of this is that we can compare and combine second-order terms without any need for context or without considering alpha-equivalence.

-- The first element in the list is the index from which to take the first argument to this argument.
-- For example, if the argument map is [1,0] in f o g, it means f(g(y,x)), whereas if it is [0,1] it means f(g(x,y)) and if it is [1,1] it means f(g(y,y)). We write this f(g[1,1])(x,y)
-- Compositions just pass down, so f(g(h[0,1],i[1,1])[1,0]) means that the first variable inside g corresponds to the second one inside f, and the second one in g to the first one in f, the first in h is the first one in g, which is the second one in f, and the second one in h is the second one in g, which is the first one in f. Same for i. All in all, f(g(h[0,1],i[1,1])[1,0])(x,y) = f(g(h(y,x),i(x,x))). Note here that the arity of f is 1 but the arity of the overall expression is 2.
