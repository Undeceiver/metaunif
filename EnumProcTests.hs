-- Even if we diagonalized instead of concatenating the lists (which I did not do because I don't have an implemented function diagonalize :: [[t]] -> [t] right now, even if I know how to do it), this would still not work.
-- The reason is that the filter 1 will return no values at all for some of the multiples, and a regular diagonalization would, in that case, end up dying when trying to produce a next element for one of the lists, because it is filtering an infinite list returning no values.
-- That's why I tried to provide a "complicated" filter 1 which isn't easily replaced by a generative function. Of course, this one can actually be replaced by a generative function, but it is already tedious. In my application, there is not that possibility: sometimes I just need to verify conditions instead of generating only those solutions that I need.
-- My implementation EnumProc, when filtering the infinite list and finding no values, generates an enumeration that, while producing no values, produces an infinite number of steps. Because diagonalization on EnumProc happens over steps rather than over values, this doesn't prevent the other lists which do return some results from outputting them.
